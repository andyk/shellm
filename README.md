```

A bash-native AI agent that thinks by writing shell commands, running them, and iterating until it has an answer. Composed of dead simple shell tools.

## Why the shell?

LLMs are text-in, text-out. The Unix shell is an environment where *everything* is text — stdin, stdout, pipes, files, environment variables. That structural alignment turns out to be deep.

Most agent frameworks give the LLM a curated menu of function calls: `search_web`, `read_file`, `run_sql`. If your menu doesn't include a capability, the model can't do it. The shell inverts this. Instead of enumerating tools, you drop the LLM into a composable environment and let it figure out what to do. `curl` is the HTTP client. `jq` is the JSON processor. `python3 -c` is the escape hatch. No schemas to define, no wrappers to write — the model composes tools the same way a human would, by piping them together.

shellm takes this idea seriously. It's four small, composable tools — all pure bash — that together form a full agent stack. Each one does one thing well. They compose through the filesystem and environment variables, just like Unix intended.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **shellm** | The core loop — sends context to Claude, executes the bash it writes back, repeats |
| **shelly** | Interactive conversational agent with identity, memory, and skills |
| **mem** | CLI memory store — markdown files with YAML frontmatter, no database |
| **skills** | Skill manager — install, create, and use SKILL.md-based agent abilities |

shellm is the engine at the center. The other three build on it to get from a stateless tool to a stateful agent — with memory, learned abilities, and persistent identity across sessions.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andyk/shellm.git
cd shellm
./install.sh
```

This copies `shellm`, `shelly`, `mem`, and `skills` to `/usr/local/bin`. Use `--symlinks` to symlink instead (edits take effect without reinstalling), or `--prefix ~/.local/bin` for a different location.

## Quick start

```bash
# Set your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Run it
shellm what is the mass of jupiter in kilograms

# Pipe data in
cat dataset.csv | shellm summarize this data and find outliers

# Pass files
shellm -f paper.pdf -f notes.txt compare these documents

# Quotes are optional for inline context
shellm research the latest advances in protein folding and write a summary
```

## How shellm works

shellm runs a loop:

1. Sends your context to Claude with a system prompt that says "write bash code"
2. Claude responds with a ` ```bash ` code block
3. shellm executes the code (in Docker if available, locally otherwise)
4. Output streams back to Claude as the next message
5. Repeat until the code sets `FINAL="answer"` or hits max iterations

The LLM has full shell access. It can curl APIs, parse data with jq, write Python scripts, call itself recursively, install packages — whatever it takes to solve the task.

### What you see

shellm streams everything live. Commands show in cyan, output in dim:

```
▶ Iteration 1/25 — calling Claude API...
▶ Executing bash (12 lines):
    curl -s "https://api.example.com/data" | jq '.results'
    ...
  $ curl -s 'https://api.example.com/data'
  $ jq '.results'
  │ {"count": 42, "items": [...]}
  $ FINAL="Found 42 results"
  Exit 0

▶ Final answer received
Found 42 results
```

If a command hangs (waiting for interactive input), the inactivity watchdog kills it after `SHELLM_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` seconds (default 30) and gives the LLM structured feedback on what went wrong.

### Completion signals

The LLM signals it has an answer by setting one of these in its bash code:

```bash
# Short answer
FINAL="The answer is 42"

# Long answer from a file
echo "detailed report..." > report.txt
FINAL_FILE=report.txt
```

shellm captures the value and prints it to stdout. Everything else (progress, commands, debug) goes to stderr, so you can pipe the final answer:

```bash
shellm -f data.csv compute the average > result.txt
```

### Context

There are three ways to pass context:

**Inline** — everything after the flags is your context (quotes optional):

```bash
shellm explain why the sky is blue
shellm "explain why the sky is blue"  # same thing
```

**Files** — use `-f` one or more times. Contents become `$FILE_CONTEXT1`, `$FILE_CONTEXT2`, etc:

```bash
shellm -f data.json analyze this
shellm -f chapter1.txt -f chapter2.txt compare these chapters
```

**Stdin** — piped data becomes `$CONTEXT`:

```bash
curl https://example.com | shellm what is this page about
git diff | shellm review this diff for bugs
```

These can be combined:

```bash
cat errors.log | shellm -f config.yaml diagnose why the service is failing
```

### Nested calls

Code generated by shellm can call shellm itself:

**`shellm "prompt"`** — starts a fresh nested run. The child gets its own conversation history and workspace. Good for independent subtasks:

```bash
# Inside generated code
category=$(shellm "classify this text as positive/negative/neutral: $text")
```

**`shellm --fork "prompt"`** — forks the current conversation history and workspace into a sub-loop. The child gets full context of what happened so far, plus its own copy of all workspace files:

```bash
# Inside generated code
result=$(shellm --fork "now take the data we found and build a visualization")
```

`--fork` is useful when a subtask needs the parent's conversation context. For independent subtasks, plain `shellm` is simpler and avoids the child re-interpreting the parent's instructions.

Nesting depth is capped by `--max-depth` (default 3) to prevent runaway costs. Sub-runs are stored inside the parent workspace under `.shellm/sub-runs/`.

### Interactive command handling

Generated code runs with stdin connected to `/dev/null`. Interactive prompts (password dialogs, `[y/N]` confirmations, `read` commands) get immediate EOF instead of hanging.

If a process produces no output for `SHELLM_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` seconds (default 30), the watchdog kills it and sends the LLM structured feedback:

```
Execution was KILLED after 30 seconds of inactivity
(likely waiting for interactive input that will never arrive).
stdin is connected to /dev/null.

DETECTED: Confirmation prompt. Retry with --yes, -y, --force,
--assume-yes, --non-interactive, or equivalent flag.
```

The LLM sees this and retries with non-interactive flags. For commands that truly need interaction, the LLM can use tmux to create a PTY session and interact with it step by step.

### Docker sandboxing

If Docker is running, shellm automatically executes code inside a container. This means:

- The LLM can't accidentally modify your host system
- It can install packages (`apt-get install`) without affecting your machine
- The container comes with bash, python3, jq, curl, and tmux pre-installed
- Your workspace directory is mounted in, so files persist across iterations

```bash
# Auto-detected (default)
shellm do something risky

# Force local execution (use the "local" workspace)
shellm --workspace local do something risky

# Use a different base image
shellm --docker-image python:3.12-slim write a flask app

# Teardown container on exit instead of persisting
shellm --temp-docker do something risky
```

Docker detection works like this:
- If Docker daemon is running and workspace isn't `local` → uses Docker
- If already inside a Docker container (e.g. CI) → runs locally (no nesting)
- If Docker isn't installed → runs locally

### Workspaces

A **workspace** is a named execution environment — either a Docker container or "local" (the host machine). Multiple runs can share a workspace, so installed packages and system modifications persist across conversations.

Each run also has a **workdir** — a file directory under `~/.shellm/runs/<timestamp>_<slug>/`:

- All generated code executes in `$SHELLM_WORKDIR`
- Files created by the agent persist across iterations
- `.final` holds the completion answer
- `.messages.json` holds conversation history
- `.shellm/sub-runs/` contains nested child runs

Workspace metadata is stored in `~/.shellm/workspaces/<name>/`.

```bash
# Inspect past runs
ls ~/.shellm/runs/

# Use a custom workdir
shellm --workdir ./my-run research something complex

# Use a named workspace (Docker container persists between runs)
shellm --workspace my-project do something
shellm --workspace my-project --continue do something else  # reuses container

# Run on host (no Docker)
shellm --workspace local do something

# Teardown container on exit
shellm --temp-docker do something risky
```

With Docker, the workdir is bind-mounted into the container at the same path, so files written inside the container appear on the host and vice versa.

### Session management

You can resume past sessions to continue where you left off:

```bash
# Resume the most recent session
shellm --continue "now summarize what you found"

# Resume a specific session by name prefix
shellm --start-from 2025-01-15 "try a different approach"
```

The resumed session picks up the full conversation history, so the LLM remembers everything from the previous run.

## From tool to agent: shelly, mem, and skills

shellm is a powerful primitive, but it's stateless. Each run starts fresh — no memory of what happened last time, no learned abilities, no persistent identity. To get from a tool to an agent, you need memory, skills, and a way to tie them together across conversations.

### mem

A file-based memory store. Each memory is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter (date, type, slug). No database needed.

```bash
# Add memories with a type
mem add "the user prefers dark mode"
mem add --type todo "buy groceries"
mem add --type value "always be honest"
mem add --type fact "the project uses React 19"

# Search and browse
mem list                    # List all (date + slug)
mem dump                    # Print all summaries
mem search "user prefs"     # Semantic search (uses shellm)

# Edit and remove
mem edit <name> "new text"  # Update a memory
mem forget <name>           # Delete by name or prefix
```

Types: `memory`, `todo`, `objective`, `value`, `belief`, `fact`, `preference`, `note`

Memories are stored as individual `.md` files in `MEM_DIR` (default: `./.memories/`). Every piece of state is a text file — inspectable, greppable, editable with any editor.

### skills

A manager for SKILL.md-based agent abilities. Skills are directories containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (name, description) and markdown instructions. They're reusable instruction sets that encode how to do specific things well — no plugin API, no SDK, just text files the LLM reads and follows.

```bash
# List installed skills
skills

# Search installed and remote (GitHub) skills
skills "web research"

# Install from GitHub
skills --install owner/repo

# Show a skill's full instructions
skills --show web-research

# Create a new skill
skills --init my-new-skill

# Remove a skill
skills --remove old-skill
```

Skills live in `SKILLS_DIR` (default: `~/.skills/`). shelly also has per-session skills in `.shelly/sessions/<id>/skills/`.

### shelly

shelly ties it all together. It's an interactive conversational agent that wraps shellm, mem, and skills into a stateful chat experience with session management.

```bash
# Start the REPL
shelly

# Or send a single message
shelly send "what's the weather in SF?"

# Send with piped input
cat report.csv | shelly send "summarize this report"
```

#### REPL

```
shelly repl (Ctrl+C to interrupt, Ctrl+D to exit)
> hello! who are you?
I'm shelly, an AI with a life context — memories, values, skills...
> /help
```

Ctrl+C interrupts a running response and returns to the prompt. Ctrl+D exits.

#### Sessions

shelly keeps conversation history per session:

```bash
shelly new              # Start a new session
shelly sessions         # List all sessions
shelly switch <id>      # Switch to a session (prefix match)
shelly history          # Show conversation history
shelly reset            # Clear current session
shelly compact          # Summarize and compact long history
```

#### Slash commands (in REPL)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new` | Start a new session |
| `/sessions` | List sessions |
| `/switch <id>` | Switch session |
| `/history` | Show history |
